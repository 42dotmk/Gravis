# Gravis
> **Project in development, more documentation and code to be added**

![Gravis](https://github.com/dimitarbez/Gravis/blob/main/images/gravis2.jpg?raw=true)

## Introduction (project still in development)
Gravis is an open-source robot with the aim to make replicating it an easy and fun process, so that anyone who is interested in robotics can get into the field and progress. Parts of Gravis are 3D printable, except for the chassis which is premade (link for it will be provided). The electronics are all readily available and relatively cheap such as the Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano and other Arduino modules which make upgrading and repairing him an easy process. This document will contain a guide on all of the parts and how they are connected, so that you can easily start making your own Gravis. The README file shall be updated consistently with new changes and it is the documentation for the entire project.

## Project roadmap
The project is still being planned so I will post updates on it regularly. The end goal is to have everything open-source, including the 3d printable parts. Soon there will be ML models on this github repository that will utilize Gravis' camera.

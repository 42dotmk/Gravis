## üåü Introduction

Gravis is an open-source robot designed to democratize robotics, making it accessible for enthusiasts and professionals alike. With parts that are mostly 3D printable and standard, easily-sourced electronics, Gravis is not just a robot; it's a platform for innovation and education in the field of robotics.

### Why Gravis?

- **Open Source**: Every aspect of Gravis, from hardware designs to software algorithms, is open for you to tweak, improve, and share.
- **Educational**: Whether you're a beginner or an expert, building and programming Gravis offers invaluable hands-on experience.
- **Customizable**: Thanks to its modular design, Gravis can be adapted for a wide range of applications and upgrades.

## üõ† Project Roadmap

While Gravis is currently under active development, our vision is clear: To provide a fully open-source robotics platform that's both powerful and easy to use. Stay tuned for:

- 3D printable parts designs
- Integration with machine learning for advanced functionalities
- Regular project updates and community contributions
